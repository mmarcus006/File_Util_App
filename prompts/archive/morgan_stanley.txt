   - Beginning asset value
   - Ending asset value
   - Net change (gain/loss)

   - CUSIP numbers
   - Quantity/shares

**Morgan Stanley Specific Hints:**

*   **Institution Name:** Set to "Morgan Stanley".
*   **Account Info:** Find Account Number ("Active Assets Account") in header. Account Holder Name under "STATEMENT FOR:".
*   **Statement Period:** Look for "For the Period Month D-D, YYYY".
*   **Statement Summary:** Use "Account Summary" (Page 3/4). "Beginning/Ending Total Value", "Change in Value". Calculate `net_contributions_withdrawals_period` from Period's Cash Flow activity if not directly stated.
*   **Cash Balances:** Use "CASH FLOW" -> "OPENING/CLOSING CASH, BDP, MMFs".
*   **Tax Summary:** Use "INCOME AND DISTRIBUTION SUMMARY" and "GAIN/(LOSS) SUMMARY" (Page 4). Extract Period ("This Period") and YTD ("This Year") values for Interest, Tax-Exempt Income, Other Dividends, Short-Term Gain, Long-Term Gain. Sum ST/LT Gain for Total Realized G/L.
*   **Holdings:** Look under "STOCKS", "EXCHANGE-TRADED & CLOSED-END FUNDS", "GOVERNMENT SECURITIES", "MUTUAL FUNDS". "Share Price"/"Unit Price", "Market Value", "Total Cost"/"Adj Total Cost", "Unrealized Gain/(Loss)". Ticker is usually in parentheses "(XXX)". CUSIP may be present for some fixed income. "ST"/"LT" often shown next to Unrealized G/L. "Est Ann Income", "Current Yield %". Accrued Interest might be in summary or fixed income details.
*   **Transactions:** Look under "CASH FLOW ACTIVITY BY DATE" (Page 9). "Activity Date" is primary date, "Settlement Date" is also available. Map "Activity Type" to `transaction_type`. "Credits/(Debits)" column is `net_amount` (ensure Debits are negative). Realized G/L per transaction is generally not shown here.
