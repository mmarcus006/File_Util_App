*   **Statement Period:** Look for "Period Covering Month DD, YYYY to Month DD, YYYY" or "Period Ended...".
*   **Statement Summary:** Use "Overview" (Page 3). Find "MARKET VALUE AS OF [Start/End Date]", "CHANGE IN MARKET VALUE". Find `net_contributions_withdrawals_period` under "INVESTMENT RESULTS" -> "Net Deposits (Withdrawals)" (Current Month).
*   **Cash Balances:** Use "Cash Activity" (Page 7) -> "CLOSING BALANCE AS OF [Previous/Current Period End Date]".
*   **Tax Summary:** Use "US Tax Summary" (Page 4) and/or "Tax Details" (Page 9). Extract Period ("Current Month") and YTD ("Year to date" or "Quarter to Date" - use YTD if available) values for Corporate Interest, Bank Interest (sum for Taxable Interest), Dividends Received. Realized G/L summaries might appear here if sales occurred, extract if present.
