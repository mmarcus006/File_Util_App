Exhibit E lists the contact information for each franchisee in our System.  Some franchisees have multiple territories.

During  our  last  fiscal  year,  no  franchisee  has  had  an  outlet  terminated,  canceled,  not  renewed,  or  has otherwise  voluntarily  or  involuntarily  ceased  to  do  business  under  the  franchise  agreement  or  has  not communicated with us within 10 weeks of the date of this Disclosure Document. If you buy this franchise, your contact information may be disclosed to other buyers when you leave the franchise system.

During the last three fiscal years, no current or former franchisees have signed confidentiality clauses that restrict them from discussing with you their experiences as a franchisee in our franchise system.

There are no trademark-specific franchisee organizations associated with the franchise system being offered in this Franchise Disclosure Document.
