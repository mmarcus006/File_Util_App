## ITEM 19 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REPRESENTATIONS

The FTC's Franchise Rule permits a franchisor to provide information about the actual or potential financial performance of its franchised and/or franchisor-owned outlets, if there is a reasonable basis for the  information,  and  the  information  is  included  in  the  disclosure  document.  Financial  performance information that differs from that included in Item 19 may be given only if: (1) a franchisor provides the actual  records  of  an  existing  outlet  you  are  considering  buying;  or  (2)  a  franchisor  supplements  the information  provided  in  this  Item  19,  for  example,  by  providing  information  about  performance  at  a particular location or under particular circumstances.

We do not make any representations about a franchisee's future financial performance or the past financial performance of Company-Owned or franchised outlets. We also do not authorize our employees or representatives to make any such representations either orally or in writing. If you are purchasing an existing outlet, however, we may provide you with the actual records of that outlet. If you receive any other financial  performance  information  or  projections  of  your  future  income,  you  should  report  it  to  the franchisor's management by contacting Kevin Skipper, 3000 Kellway Drive, Carrollton, Texas 75006 and 214-640-3916 the Federal Trade Commission, and the appropriate state regulatory agencies.
