## ITEM 18 PUBLIC FIGURES

We  have  not  paid  any  compensation  or  other  benefit  to  a  public  figure  for  the  use  of  their endorsement or recommendation of the franchise to prospective franchisees.

## ITEM 19

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REPRESENTATIONS

The FTC's Franchise Rule permits a franchisor to provide information about the actual or potential financial performance of its franchised and/or franchisor-owned outlets, if there is a reasonable basis for the information, and if the information is included in the disclosure document.  Financial performance information that differs from that included in Item 19 may be given only if: (1) a franchisor provides the actual records of an existing outlet you are considering buying; or (2) a franchisor  supplements  the  information  provided  in  this  Item  19,  for  example,  by  providing information about possible performance at a particular location or under particular circumstances.

We do not make any financial performance representations about a franchisee's future financial performance or the past financial performance of company-owned or franchised outlets.  We also do not authorize our employees or representatives to make any such representations either orally or in writing.  If you are purchasing an existing outlet, however, we may provide you with actual records of that outlet.  If you receive any other financial performance information or projections of your future income, you should report it to the franchisor's management by contacting Christy Ford, Scout Guide, LLC, 3465 Ivy Road, Charlottesville, Virginia 22903, (434) 244-2817; the Federal Trade Commission, and the appropriate state regulatory agencies.
